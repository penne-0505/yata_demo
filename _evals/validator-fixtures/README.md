# Validator fixtures

These fixtures exercise the repository validators themselves.

They are not active project tasks or QA records. `scripts/test-validators.mjs`
runs the validators against these files and expects:

- files under `valid/` to pass;
- files under `invalid/` to fail.

The intent and QA fixtures run through their validators with `--fixture` and
use `fixture_path` front matter so the validators can apply the normal
canonical-path rules while the fixture files remain under `_evals/`.

The QA invalid fixture without `qa_schema` also verifies legacy compatibility:
legacy plans still require an `INV-*`, while schema v2 accepts `None`.

The frontmatter fixtures verify that schema markers are accepted only for their
document type and version. Unknown fields, unknown schema markers, and duplicate
keys fail instead of being silently overwritten or downgraded to warnings.
